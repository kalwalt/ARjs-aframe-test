# ðŸš€ Welcome to ARjs-aframe-test!

This project serve as a test for the @ar-js-org/ar.js-threejs module with aframe. Enter in the arjs-aframe-js folder and try one of the examples.
The idea is to test the @ar-js-org/ar.js-threejs in a javascript environment with aframe (arjs-aframe-js) and in a typescript environment (arjs-aframe-ts, not yet available...).
This could be a starting point for a new AR.js module.

## Feature to add
- [ ] arjs-aframe-ts to test the module with Typescript.
- [ ] typescript definitions for both
- [ ] support for NFT markers
- [ ] more examples
